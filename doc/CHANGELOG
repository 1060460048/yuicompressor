YUI Compressor 1.1, 2007-08-xx
------------------------------

+ Java source now in package com.yahoo.platform.yui.compressor
+ Added --line-break option that adds a line feed character after each
  semi-colon character
+ Added support for missing JavaScript features (get, set, const)
+ Do not show the entire stack trace when the input file cannot be found.
+ Removed the randomization of obfuscated symbols. When compressed code is
  checked in CVS, unchanged files would end up being versioned.
+ Added web-based front-end to the YUI Compressor as part of the dist package.
+ Added a public entry point that makes the YUI Compressor easy to integrate
  with an already existing Java application.
+ Simplified code by using the same parsing routines used to build the symbol
  tree while looking for undeclared symbols.
+ Count how many times each identifier is used, and display a warning when an
  identifier seems to be unused (code cannot be removed by the compressor!)
+ Remove ';' when followed by a '}'. This yields an additional ~1.5% savings
  on yahoo-dom-event.js compared to the JSMin version.
