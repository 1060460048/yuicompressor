YUI Compressor 1.1, 2007-08-xx
------------------------------

- Java source now in package com.yahoo.platform.yui.compressor
- Added --line-break option that adds a line feed character after each semi-colon character
- Added support for missing JavaScript features (get, set, const)
- Improved error message when file not found (don't display the whole stack trace)
- Removed the randomization of obfuscated symbols. When compressed code is checked
  in CVS, an unchanged file would end up being versioned every time it is built.
- Added a web-based front-end to the YUI Compressor as part of the dist package.
- Added a public entry point that makes the YUI Compressor easy to integrate with
  an already existing Java application.
